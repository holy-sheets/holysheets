# Introduction

HolySheets! aims to make working with Google Sheets as effortless as working with a database. Instead of worrying about A1 notations and raw API calls, you focus on data operations and filters.

Key features:

- No need to manage A1 ranges directly.
- CRUD-like operations (find, insert, update, delete, clear).
- Flexible querying with filters like `contains`, `startsWith`, `gt`, `in`, etc.
- Optional metadata for each operation.
- Fully typed and IntelliSense-friendly in Typescript.
